<h1 align="center">Welcome to my profile!</h1>

Hey there, random internet dweller, welcome to my profile! My name is Michal Proch√°zka, and I'm a student currently living in the Czech Republic.

I work on lots of cool projects, feel free to go through my repos and see if you like something.

[üåç Please visit my website for some extra stuff that isn't here!](https://www.prochazkaml.eu/)

**NOTE (09 Jan 2023): Freenom has without prior notice removed my old domain name (prochazka.ml) without the option of re-registering it, so I had to move to another (paid) domain. Some parts of the site still may be a bit janky, so please forgive me if you run into some sort of error. I'm currently in the process of replacing all mentions/links pointing to the old domain to point to the new one. I apologize for the inconvenience.**
